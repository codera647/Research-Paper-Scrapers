## Websites

1. **<u>Econbiz:</u>** <br>
 [EconBiz](https://www.econbiz.de) is a service of the ZBW - Leibniz Information Centre for Economics. That support you with your search for scholarly information. Thet don't specifically provide any *Api Endpoints* to extract data so I use [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/) to scrap research papers and articles.

2. **<u>Google Scholar:</u>** <br>
  [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en) provides a simple way to broadly search for scholarly literature. Although there is no official *Google Scholar Api* but there are third-party solutions like [Scholarly](https://github.com/scholarly-python-package/scholarly) Python package which supports profile, author, cite and organic results (search_pubs seems to be the method to get organic results, although method name confuses me).

3. **<u>Scopus:</u>** <br>
  [Scopus](https://www.elsevier.com/products/scopus) is a database that offers a comprehensive overview of global interdisciplinary scientific information, covering the areas of science, technology, medicine, social sciences and the arts and humanity. There is a solution named [Scopus Search Api](https://dev.elsevier.com/documentation/ScopusSearchAPI.wadl) provided by [Elsevier Developer Portal](https://dev.elsevier.com) that assist you to get access to scopus open-source database.

4. **<u>Zendy:</u>** <br>
  [Zendy](https://zendy.io) offers a blended discovery experience where you can read and download open access and paywalled research from the worldâ€™s leading publishers on one platform. Using zendy api we can access variety of articles and research papers.
